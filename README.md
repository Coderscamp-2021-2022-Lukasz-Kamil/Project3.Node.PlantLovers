# Project3.Node.PlantLovers

Important things:

1. Create .env file and copy example.env content into it. .env is file which be recognized in our app for envs
2. Please update example.env when adding some envs, can be without content when this is some key ore app secret but add it declaration as well
3. Everything for backend have to be in server folder, and everything for frontend in client folder. In these folders would be separate package.json files with dependencies, scripts etc. Do not create package.json outside this folder for now. Only one purpose for global package.json would be when we will want to run server and client concurrently (only for deploy when it would be necessary).
4. To run app in development mode, just execute command npm run dev (in server folder).
5. To run eslint, just execute command npm run lint:eslint (in server folder).
